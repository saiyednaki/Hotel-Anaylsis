**Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis**

**Project Overview**

City Hotel and Resort Hotel have experienced high booking cancellation rates, leading to reduced revenue and inefficient room utilization.
This project analyzes hotel booking data to identify the key factors influencing cancellations and provides data-driven recommendations to help hotels reduce cancellations, improve pricing strategies, and increase overall revenue.

The analysis focuses on booking behavior, pricing patterns, customer sources, and seasonal trends.

**Business Problem**

  - High cancellation rates result in:
  - Lost revenue
  - Vacant rooms
  - Inefficient resource utilization
  - The primary goal of this analysis is to understand why customers cancel bookings and how hotels can reduce cancellations while supporting better pricing and promotional decisions.

**Research Questions**
  1. What factors influence hotel booking cancellations?
  2. How can cancellation rates be reduced?
  3. How can insights support pricing and marketing strategies?

**Hypotheses**
  - Higher prices lead to higher cancellation rates
  - Longer waiting periods increase the likelihood of cancellations
  - Most reservations are made through travel agents rather than direct bookings

**Dataset & Assumptions**
  - Booking data from 2015–2017
  - No major external disruptions affecting trends
  -- Cancellations result in vacant rooms
  - Customers cancel bookings within the same year
  - Hotels are not currently using the proposed strategies

**Methodology**
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Comparison of:
    - City Hotel vs Resort Hotel
    - Canceled vs non-canceled bookings
    - Average Daily Rate (ADR)
    - Monthly and country-wise trends
  - Analysis of booking channels (Online, Offline, Groups, Direct)

**Key Findings**
  - 37% of total bookings are canceled, significantly impacting revenue
  - City hotels receive more bookings than resort hotels
  - Cancellations increase as Average Daily Rate (ADR) increases
  - August has the highest number of bookings and cancellations
  - January shows the highest cancellation rate
  - Portugal has the highest number of canceled reservations
  - Most bookings come from Online Travel Agencies (46%)
  - Very few customers book directly with hotels

**Business Recommendations**
  - Implement dynamic pricing strategies to reduce cancellations at higher price points
  - Offer targeted discounts for resort hotels on weekends and holidays
  - Launch promotional campaigns in January to reduce cancellations
  - Improve service quality and customer experience, especially in high-cancellation regions like Portugal
  - Encourage direct bookings through loyalty programs or exclusive offers

**Tools & Skills**
  - Python
  - Pandas, NumPy
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Business & marketing insights

**Conclusion**

This analysis demonstrates that pricing, seasonality, and booking channels strongly influence hotel booking cancellations.
By adopting data-driven pricing strategies and targeted marketing efforts, hotels can reduce cancellations, improve occupancy rates, and enhance revenue performance.
